      <h5>My whole life I have loved the idea of money. Particularly saving money. That is why I want to go into finance when I get older. I love the stock market and know a lot about my age. I invested my money into mutual funds and different stocks that give dividends. I don't wanna be stupid so I'm not gonna risk my money if I know I have the ability and can make a decent amount on it every year while making a profit while it rises. For example, fidelity contra fund has been up 13.1 percent since 1967.</h5>

      <h5>One of my big goals for high school is web design. I'm new to all of this and I haven't had the most experience I always run into problems and I'm always behind on work but I do enjoy it. I think of it as a break from school. I have no stress at all and it's fun to just listen to music and teach myself about coding.</h5>
